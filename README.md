# Money Machines

*A blog about using cellular automata to model financial and investment markets.*

`Money Machines` is a blog about using CA (cellular automata), and machines to simulate and study finanical and investment markets. It is an effort to greatly expand our understanding of CA, and automatan-based programming in complex, dynamic, finanical systems.

If you are not familiar with CA or other types of automatan, you can read the [introduction here](/introduction.md).

### Languages

This blog will use a variety of programming languages, but focus primarily on `C`, `C++`, and `Python`. We will also likely explore and visit some implementations in `Rust` and `JavaScript`.

### Examples

Nearly all of the code examples found in the blog posts can be located in the examples/ directory of this repo.
