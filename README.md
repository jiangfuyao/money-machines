# Money Machines

*A blog about using cellular automata to model financial and investment markets.*

`Money Machines` is a blog about using CA (cellular automata), and machines to simulate and study finanical and investment markets. It is an effort to greatly expand our understanding of CA, and automatan-based programming in complex, dynamic, finanical systems. This blog's intended audience are programmers, engineers, investment bankers, algorithmic traders, researchers, graduate students, and anyone with an interest in complex financial modeling and computer science.

If you are not familiar with CA or other types of automatan, you can read the [introduction here](/introduction.md).

#### Languages

This blog will use a variety of programming languages, but focus primarily on `C`, `C++`, and `Python`. We will also likely explore and visit some implementations in `Rust` and `JavaScript`.

#### Examples

Nearly all of the code examples found in the blog posts can be located in the examples/ directory of this repo. Larger, buildable code examples will be removed to their own repos.
